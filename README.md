# Development of Smart Home Appliances Control using an Emulated IoT-Environment
This project aims to develop an IoT based Smart Home Application in which different appliances or IoT devices will communicate with each other and based on their interaction, they will perform their tasks.
An emulated IoT Environment has to be developed which will have different IoT devices. These IoT devices will be sensors and actuators.
This project mainly focuses on Appliances Control such as heater, blinds etc. Also, the appliances will have the functionality to be controlled both manually and automatically.
Therefore, along with IoT environment, an IoT Gateway has also to be developed in order to perform protocol translations because IoT devices will be based on CoAP protocol and web services will be based on HTTP protocol.
Through web service, user can watch and control all these appliances on a web browser.
